NRF in general seems to be a good resource. I think their acronymic name is a sound indicator: national retail federation. There's some data in the article that's absent in the data tables. This gives us some possibilities in terms of data display. Also, the histograms are *boring* and have...interactivity? If you hover over the bar graphs, for instance, they display the exact same info one gleans from reading the x-y axes.

We could also clean from this some useful info.

There appears to be conflicting data regarding the frequency and insanity of online v. in-store shopping. Could this also be a dataset? E.g., http://fortune.com/2016/11/27/black-friday-nrf-shopping/ and http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/27/news/companies/black-friday-national-retail-federation/index.html and http://fortune.com/2016/11/18/black-friday-2016-shoppers/

I also think it prudent to talk about per-shopper spending. Because it's _insane_. How does the level of spending on this one day compare to gross spending? Do these binge-spenders made a habit of splurging, if there's data on this, whether per Black Friday or altogether? (I also suspect that some parts of these questions may be outside our focus.)
